  "security_03_headline": "Resistance to Attacks",
  "security_03_text": "Because a block must include 3 or more ticket votes to be valid, blocks must be broadcast on the network as they are mined for the chain to proceed, so miners cannot mine in secret.  The result is that an attacker must have a considerable combination of hashpower and stake to successfully execute a majority attack. Decred voters are also set to reject a re-org of greater than 6 blocks, so any attack involving a deep re-org is unlikely to be accepted by the network. When comparing the cost of an attack on Decred to that of a pure PoW cryptocurrency, the cost to attack Decred is an order of magnitude greater, plus any attacker with stake would be taking actions counter to their interests.",

  "sustainability_01_headline": "The tragedy of the commons",
  "sustainability_01_text": "Digital currencies and open source projects typically fall victim to the tragedy of the commons, where individuals who share a resource act in their own self-interest, depleting or spoiling that resource. Numerous methods have been used to solve the funding issue across cryptocurrencies, including donations, founders funds, venture capital funding, and various forms of ICO/IEO. All of these methods come with shortcomings, including agency problems, conflicts of interest, and a lack of ongoing funding.",
  "sustainability_02_headline": "Decred’s Self-Funding Solution",
  "sustainability_02_text": "Decred has solved the funding problem by directing 10% of every block reward into a Project Treasury. This ongoing solution funds Decred for generations to come. To this point, the Treasury has been managed conservatively with a long-term perspective in mind and cognizant of the release of Politeia in 2018, which transitioned control of funds to the Decred stakeholders. Through Politiea, stakeholders vote on budgets, policies, and the direction of the project as a Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO).",
  "sustainability_03_headline": "A new work paradigm",
  "sustainability_03_text": "<p>The DAO ushers in a new work paradigm, one in which anyone with valuable skills can contribute to the project and be compensated by the stakeholders per proposals and voting on Politeia. In Decred, community members develop, market, and represent Decred, and they are judged on their contributions, not their pedigree or CV. The conventional work world and hierarchical structure goes out the door as contributors are free to work on what they want, when they want.</p><p>Most contributors have full time jobs and perform their work with passion in their free time. This enables a risk-minimized on-ramp for people to test the waters before deciding to join Decred as a full-time contractor and leave the legacy corporate world behind.</p>",
  "sustainability_04_headline": "Contractors and Proposals",
  "sustainability_04_text": "Decred is a community of self-starters and autonomous workers who relish adversity and know how to chart their own path. They can identify their own skills and examine the current state of Decred within the domains of development, marketing, research, or community to determine where and how they can contribute. They follow the path laid forth by previous contractors and contribute first to demonstrate the quality of their work product. When their work is recognized by other Contractors and funded by a Politeia proposal, they too, can become a contractor. The first place to explore is the Matrix chat rooms, which are bridged to the other communications platforms.",
  "sustainability_introtext": "Remaking the financial system in a more fair and inclusive way mandates that Decred and its community operate on a long time horizon. To realize Decred as a superior long-term store of value, every effort and expenditure needs to serve its long term goals.",

  "history_01_headline": "Decred History",
  "history_01_text": "<p>Decred is based on a <a href=\"https://decred.org/research/mackenzie2013.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">proposal</a> for the Memcoin2 cryptocurrency from April 2013 on the Bitcointalk forum. The user, tacotime, proposed the new cryptocurrency and worked with _ingsoc, another Bitcointalk user, and Jake Yocom-Piatt to implement the hybrid Proof-of-Work (“PoW”) / Proof-of-Stake (“PoS”) consensus system from Memcoin2 as a new project, called Decred.</p><p>The major innovation of this hybrid consensus system was that it created a PoS governance mechanism, where users opt-in to temporarily lock their coins in exchange for participation in a lottery. These users are called stakeholders. Several winners of this lottery are selected each block to participate in the consensus system by voting, which puts sovereignty over decisions about Decred directly in the hands of its stakeholders. </p><p>In contrast, every pure PoW cryptocurrency must rely primarily on its miners for governance decisions since they alone enforce the consensus system and provide its security. However, Decred relies on both its stakeholders and miners for consensus and its security. The end result is that Decred’s hybrid PoW/PoS consensus system is both substantially fairer and more secure than pure PoW systems.</p><p>Decred’s code was built on the <a href=\"https://github.com/btcsuite/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">btcsuite</a> codebase, an alternative full node Bitcoin implementation in Go, written by Company 0 LLC.  Despite Decred being based on Bitcoin’s code, it is a standalone cryptocurrency, not a “Bitcoin fork”.  This work began in February 2014 and continued with the assistance of Company 0 LLC until its mainnet launch in February 2016.</p>",

Given the necessity of distribution, this process was determined to be fair, transparent, and yielded significant decentralization from the outset.",
